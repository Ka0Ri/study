        "In this tutorial, we will take a closer look at autoencoders (AE). Autoencoders are trained on encoding input data such as images into a smaller feature vector, and afterward, reconstruct it by a second neural network, called a decoder. The feature vector is called the \"bottleneck\" of the network as we aim to compress the input data into a smaller amount of features. This property is useful in many applications, in particular in compressing data or comparing images on a metric beyond pixel-level comparisons. Besides learning about the autoencoder framework, we will also see the \"deconvolution\" (or transposed convolution) operator in action for scaling up feature maps in height and width. Such deconvolution networks are necessary wherever we start from a small feature vector and need to output an image of full size (e.g. in VAE, GANs, or super-resolution applications).\n",

        "The mean squared error pushes the network to pay special attention to those pixel values its estimate is far away. Predicting 127 instead of 128 is not important when reconstructing, but confusing 0 with 128 is much worse. Note that in contrast to VAEs, we do not predict the probability per pixel value, but instead use a distance measure. This saves a lot of parameters and simplifies training. To get a better intuition per pixel, we report the summed squared error averaged over the batch dimension (any other mean/sum leads to the same result/parameters).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, MSE has also some considerable disadvantages. Usually, MSE leads to blurry images where small noise/high-frequent patterns are removed as those cause a very low error. To ensure realistic images to be reconstructed, one could combine Generative Adversarial Networks (lecture 10) with autoencoders as done in several works (e.g. see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02304), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05644) or these [slides](http://elarosca.net/slides/iccv_autoencoder_gans.pdf)). Additionally, comparing two images using MSE does not necessarily reflect their visual similarity. For instance, suppose the autoencoder reconstructs an image shifted by one pixel to the right and bottom. Although the images are almost identical, we can get a higher loss than predicting a constant pixel value for half of the image (see code below). An example solution for this issue includes using a separate, pre-trained CNN, and use a distance of visual features in lower layers as a distance measure instead of the original pixel-level comparison."

This correlates to the chosen loss function, here Mean Squared Error on pixel-level because the background is responsible for more than half of the pixels in an average image. Hence, the model learns to focus on it. Nevertheless, we can see that the encodings also separate a couple of classes in the latent space although it hasn't seen any labels. This shows again that autoencoding can also be used as a \"pre-training\"/transfer learning task before classification."

        "In this tutorial, we have implemented our own autoencoder on small RGB images and explored various properties of the model. In contrast to variational autoencoders, vanilla AEs are not generative and can work on MSE loss functions. This makes them often easier to train. Both versions of AE can be used for dimensionality reduction, as we have seen for finding visually similar images beyond pixel distances. Despite autoencoders gaining less interest in the research community due to their more \"theoretically\" challenging counterpart of VAEs, autoencoders still find usage in a lot of applications like denoising and compression. Hence, AEs are an essential tool that every Deep Learning engineer/researcher should be familiar with."
